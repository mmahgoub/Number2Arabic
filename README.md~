Number2Arabic
=================

A function for converting numbers into Arabic written text such as 230,000 = مئتان وثلاثون ألف. This function is very handy if you are trying to print invoices, contracts or any financial document really.

This function has been ported from PHP and it is the work of Ahmad Mazyad [which could be found here] (http://www.phpclasses.org/package/7559-PHP-Convert-number-to-Arabic-words.html) "Number to Arabic: Convert number to Arabic words - PHP Classes").


Also PHP to JavaScript conversion tool has been used for porting except for some modifications here and there. [It could be found here.] (http://www.basereality.com/JavaScript/) "PHP to JavaScript conversion").

Some core PHP functions such as count, strlng etc. has been replaced by the ones found in [phpjs.] (http://phpjs.org) "php.js is a resource that offers community-built JavaScript alternatives to PHP functions.").

This work has been done in a hurry I appreciate everyones contribution to make it better.
